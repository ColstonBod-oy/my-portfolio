        I also tried Game Development, but eventually, I discovered{' '}
        <span className='underline'>Mobile Development</span>, which became my
        primary area of interest. I am proficient with technologies such as{' '}

        <span className='italic'>When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
